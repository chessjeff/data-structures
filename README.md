# Data Structures

This is a repository where I practice building data structures.

## Linked List 
The linked-lists folder contains modules that <ol><li> builds a list node, and</li> <li>builds a list of nodes and assigns methods to it.</li></ol> Currently, to see a demonstration of the linked list and it's methods, clone this repo, navigate to the directory and type node main.js in the command line.

## Hash Map
The hash-map folder contains modules that builds a hash map or a hash set with all of it's methods attached. 

Methods in the hash map module include <code>hash(key)</code>, <code>set(key, value)</code>, <code>get(key)</code>, <code>has(key)</code>, <code>remove(key)</code>, <code>length()</code>, <code>clear()</code>, <code>keys()</code>, <code>values</code>, and <code>entries()</code>. Methods in the hash set module are generally the same but exclude <code>value</code> in the <code>set()</code> function. The <code>get()</code>, <code>values()</code>, and <code>entries()</code> functions are also excluded.
