# Data Structures

This is a repository where I practice building data structures.

## Linked List 
The linked-lists folder contains modules that <ol><li> builds a list node, and,</li> <li>builds a list of nodes and assigns methods to it.</li></ol> Currently, to see a demonstration of the linked list and it's methods, clone this repo, navigate to the directory and type node main.js in the command line.
